I think I should do ... (reasoning)

[add code]
```python
class MyController(Controller):
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    def act(observation: Observation) -> ActionType:
        return "forward"
```

[delete my_old_function]

[set code to task 2]
```python
controller = MyController()
perform_test(controller, 2)
```
