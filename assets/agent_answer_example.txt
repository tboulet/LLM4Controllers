Reasoning :
I think I should take into account ... (reasoning)

New controller (this block is optional):
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Any, Dict, List
from env.base_meta_env import Observation, Action
from agent.base_controller import Controller

class ControllerForMovingToGoal(Controller):
    def __init__(self, goal_coords):
        self.goal_coords = goal_coords

    def act(self, observation):
        # Implement your logic here
        return action

    def has_finished(self):
        # Implement your logic here
        return True
```

Controller instanciation:
```python
controller = ControllerForMovingToGoal(goal_coords=(5, 3))
```
