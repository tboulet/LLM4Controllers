Reasoning :
I think I should take into account ... (reasoning)

Controller:
```python
# Eventually you can define a class here
class ControllerForMovingToGoal(Controller):
    """A controller that will move to a specific goal coordinates.
    """

    def __init__(self, goal_coords : Tuple[int, int]):
        """
        Args:
            goal_coords (Tuple[int, int]): The coordinates of the goal.
        """
        self.goal_coords = goal_coords

    def act(self, observation : Observation) -> ActionType:
        """
        Args:
            observation (Observation): The observation of the environment.
        
        Returns:
            ActionType: The action to perform.
        """
        # some code here
        return action

    def has_finished(self) -> bool:
        """
        Returns:
            bool: True if the controller has finished, False otherwise.
        """
        # some code here
        return boolean

# Instantiate the controller here, either from imported controllers or from the class you defined if you did
controller = ControllerForMovingToGoal(goal_coords=(5, 3))
```
