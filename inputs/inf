I see that there are 4 tasks available: GoTowardsDirection, GiveGoalPositionEnv, MoveToPosition, and GiveAgentPositionEnv. Each task has its own observation space and action space, and I can get their descriptions and code representations.

To start, I want to gather information about the tasks by printing their descriptions. This will help me understand the observation and action spaces, and the missions I need to solve. Then, I will try to run a simple controller that just moves forward in one of the tasks to see how the environment behaves.

I will first print the descriptions of all four tasks.

<code:exec>
```python
for i, task in enumerate(tasks):
    desc = task.get_description()
    print(f"Task {i+1} description:")
    print(desc)
    print("\n" + "="*40 + "\n")
```
</code:exec>
