Reasoning :
I think I should take into account ... (reasoning)

New primitive controller:
```python
class TurnToRight(Controller):
    """A controller that will turn to a specific direction (0: up, 1: right, 2: down, 3: left).
    It uses the 'left' and 'right' actions to turn towards the desired direction.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the controller with the target direction.

        Args:
            direction_target (int): the target direction to turn to (0: up, 1: right, 2: down, 3: left).
        """
        self.direction_target = 2
        self.do_has_finished = False

    def act(self, observation: Observation) -> ActionType:
        """Return a 'left' or 'right' action to turn towards the target direction.
        It is done by comparing the current direction with the target direction.
        If the controller direction is already the target direction, it returns 'done' (no action).

        Args:
            observation (Observation): the observation from the environment.

        Returns:
            ActionType: the action to take in the environment.

        direction = observation["direction"]

    def has_finished(self) -> bool:

```

Refactored controller for task 3:
```python
from agent.base_controller import Controller, Observation, ActionType
from controller_library import TurnToRight

controller = TurnToRight()
```
