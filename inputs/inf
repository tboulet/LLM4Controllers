I see that there are 4 tasks available: GoTowardsDirection, GiveGoalPositionEnv, MoveToPosition, and GiveAgentPositionEnv. Each task has its own observation space and action space, and I can get their descriptions and code representations.

To start, I want to gather information about the tasks by printing their descriptions. This will help me understand the observation and action spaces, and the missions I need to solve. Then, I will try to run a simple controller that just moves forward in one of the tasks to see how the environment behaves.

I will first print the descriptions of all four tasks.

<code:exec>
```python
task = agentic.get_task("GiveGoalPositionEnv(size=self.size, ),")
controller = FindFGoalPosition()
feedback = agentic.submit_controller_to_task(controller, task=task)
```
</code:exec>
