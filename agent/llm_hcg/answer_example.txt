Reasoning :
I think I should take into account ... (reasoning)

Controller:
```python
class ControllerForMovingToGoal(Controller):
    # Explain the principle of the controller here
    """A controller that will move to a specific goal coordinates.
    """

    def __init__(self, goal_coords : Tuple[int, int]):
        # Detail the signature here
        """
        Args:
            goal_coords (Tuple[int, int]): The coordinates of the goal.
        """
        # Implement your code here
        self.goal_coords = goal_coords

    def act(self, observation : Observation) -> ActionType:
        # Detail the signature here
        """
        Args:
            observation (Observation): The observation of the environment.
        
        Returns:
            ActionType: The action to perform.

        # Implement your logic here

        Returns:
            bool: True if the controller has finished, False otherwise.
